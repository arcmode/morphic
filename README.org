#+BEGIN_abstract
Boilerplate code is an underrated problem and reveals gaps in a system's model: one-time chunks of non-reusable code and other necessary evils that are usually
abstracted away as a mixture of scaffolding, library code and configuration are cheap to buy but can come as very
expensive to replace later on. There is accidental complexity in most if not all boilerplate code around any /main/ function or any source
code module that depends on a library or framework. This document describes a generalization of the /serverless/ pattern and describes it as
the /frameless/ pattern. The generalization is driven by the application of /separation of concerns/ between module and system domains.
The PoC project in TypeScript introduces Rest-oriented modularity contracts with some dependency management and example modules with zero boilerplate
and zero imports from platform or framework libraries. Additionally, it is discussed how this pattern can facilitate evolution and co-evolution of
product and platform streams of work within the dynamics of the agile organization model.

* TL;DR;

A frameless pattern is the result of applying separation of concerns between modular functionality and boilerplate code.
It replaces API dependency code and any boilerplate by leveraging contracts that task the platform to provide development and
production scripts to test, run, debug, deploy, package, build or any arbitrary task.

Focus on adopting standards and implementing them reusing the best technology available and context.

** Frameless signature
   - Zero boilerplate
   - Zero module dependency on platform API

The frameless pattern is a generalization of serverless patterns focused on the following goals:
- Separation of concerns (principle)
- API first (pattern, paradigm)
- Platform as a Service (architecture)

* Why modeling modularity matters
** Separation of concerns
   Most projects grow in a modular pace, adding new features incrementally to do the work that is required.
   Also, most projects work on top of a given platform, /composed/ by the set of languages, frameworks and libraries that together provide at least
   one and sometimes several modularity models from which most projects pick one for each kind of module (job, route, library, DOM component, cli, etc).
   A modularity model provides separation between module and system concerns is enforced by design.

** Evolvability
   In modular software, any code-editing required to /migrate/ a given module into a different /framework/ can be considered evitable
   and patterns that add work to that task can be considered anti-patterns.
   Having a module model decouples product features from platform (see previous point about separation of concerns and modularity). Being able to
   work on platform features without blocking product stories is highly desirable. Collaboration in parallel is facilitated by the module contract serving
   as reference for both sides.

** Consistency
   Most web projects require significant boilerplate code in order to run production applications. One of the most obvios properties 
   of modular systems is the bigger number of running programs. The combination of modularity with patterns and tools that increase
   boilerplate code creates a space for inconsistency that affects modular systems as they adopt new features and behavior not
   yet defined within the "boilerplate-free" area of library and framework code.

** Cycle time
   Short and predictable cycle times are an important contributing factor to the success of agile teams. During development, having a defined modularity model
   makes the work in solutions space more predictable. Also, a minimal contract reduces the amount of glue-code which makes modules leaner.
   If adopting new technology involves touching the internal modules of a project then innovation faces resistance as it can easily disrupt agile workflows.

* How
*** Modularity Model

    Let's pretend we are going to start a new project. Instead of going through the usual ritual of:

    1) Select framework and libraries
    2) Write some boilerplate code
    3) Implement a set of modules following the modularity model from framework

    Let's try the frameless approach:

    1) Define modularity model via a /platform/ function: ~platform : modules -> features~
    2) Implement the platform function as a thin wrapper that can include a module as part of predefined boilerplate
    3) Define boilerplate according to /your/ platform
    4) Implement set of modules following /your/ modularity model

    Let's imagine for example a common kind of project for "web" projects: Rest API in NodeJS.
    
    Let's define our /Rest module/ model in TypeScript trying to achieve the /minimum viable interface/
    required to know what the module /does/ in the context of the specific project (Rest API).
    
    A Rest module must define a url and method.
#+BEGIN_SRC typescript
  export const url = '/hello-rest/:name'
  export const method = 'GET'
#+END_SRC

    Also, it must define a /schema/.
#+BEGIN_SRC typescript
  export const schema = {
      response: {
          200: {
              type: 'object',
              properties: {
                  greetings: {
                      type: 'string'
                  }
              }
          },
          500: {
              type: 'object',
              properties: {
                  errors: {
                      type: 'array',
                      items: {
                          type: 'string'
                      }
                  }
              }
          }
      }
  }
#+END_SRC

    And finally a /handler/ that is to be invoked with requests and expected to return responses.

#+BEGIN_SRC typescript
  export const handler = async (req: Request): Promise<Result> => {
      try {
          return {
              status: 200,
              body: {
                  greetings: `Hello ${name}`
              }
          }
      } catch (err) {
          return {
              status: 500,
              body: {
                  errors: [err.message]
              }
          }
      }
  }
#+END_SRC

    Note how the auxiliary types /Request/ and /Response/ are not exported or imported which means
    zero source-code dependency with platform API's. The request/response model follows the HTTP
    protocol. HTTP is a stable and standard family of specs and is in the guts of every Rest service.

#+BEGIN_SRC typescript
  type Request = {
      params: {
          name: string
      }
  }

  type Result = {
      status: 200,
      body: {
          greetings: string
      }
  } | {
      status: 500,
      body: {
          errors: string[]
      }
  }
#+END_SRC

   Then, the /minimum viable interface/ for our newly born Rest module can be defined as
#+BEGIN_SRC typescript
  type RestMod<
      Query,
      Params,
      Headers,
      Body,
      Config extends string,
      Result,
  > = {
      url: string,
      method: 'GET' | 'POST' | 'PUT' | 'PATCH' | 'DELETE',
      schema: RouteSchema<object>,
      config?: Record<Config, string | undefined>,
      handler: (
          req: RestRequest<Query, Params, Headers, Body>,
          cfg: Record<Config, string>
      ) => Promise<Result>
  };
#+END_SRC

   The complete implementation can be found in the following git [[https://github.com/drojas/morphic/blob/master/modules/rest/lib/morphic-rest.ts][repository]].

   Now let's solve the boilerplate from the requirements we know given the module type definition. The first
   chunk has to be about importing dependencies. In this case the implementation is based on a function that
   takes a Rest module and returns a /fastify/ plugin and the corresponding boilerplate code required to put them
   to work.
   
#+BEGIN_SRC typescript
  import fastify from 'fastify';
  import { createFastifyPlugin } from '@frameless/rest';
  import config from 'config';
#+END_SRC

   After the framework and libraries are imported let's import the actual Rest modules (one for this example)

#+BEGIN_SRC typescript
  /*
   * import rest modules
   */
  import * as morphicExamplesHelloRest from '@frameless-examples/hello-rest';
#+END_SRC

   Let's just borrow a fastify server for this example.

#+BEGIN_SRC typescript

  const instance = fastify({
      logger: true
  });
#+END_SRC

   Now we need to add the routes from all modules to the server.

#+BEGIN_SRC typescript
  /*
   * add base plugins for initialization
   */

  /*
   * add rest modules to the service
   */
  instance.register(createFastifyPlugin(morphicExamplesHelloRest, config));
#+END_SRC

   And let's finalize the boilerplate with the usual port configuration and server initialization.

#+BEGIN_SRC typescript
  const PORT = config.has('PORT')
      ? parseInt(config.get('PORT'), 10)
      : 0;

  instance.listen(PORT, (err: Error, address: string) => {
      if (err) {
          throw err;
      }
      instance.log.info(`server listening on ${address}`);
  });
#+END_SRC
   
   This pattern allows your to provide /features as a service/ implemented as a (platform) function of your modules.
   The platform can provide by proxy any framework or library-like functionality including configurations, dependencies, scripts, etc.
   This contributes to continuous improvement and agile goals because it means new developments on the platform can automatically be leveraged
   by individual modules and teams without having to make code changes to each module.

   The following are two programming-oriented definition of modularity from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modularity
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
In modular programming, modularity refers to the compartmentalization and interrelation of the parts of a software package.
#+END_QUOTE
   This definition seems focused on modularity as an exercise of separation of concerns within business domains. For this exercise we are looking
   for a definition more focused on modularity as an exercise of separation of concerns within module vs platform concerns. The following is more useful
   for our purposes here. Also from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modularity.
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
In software design, modularity refers to a logical partitioning of the "software design" that allows complex software to be manageable
for the purpose of implementation and maintenance. The logic of partitioning may be based on related functions, implementation
considerations, data links, or other criteria.
#+END_QUOTE
   This idea of modularity is clearly aligned with the /shortest path/ and /incremental/ principles of agile methodologies and others.
